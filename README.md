***
I did this demo in 2 days (7 hours totaly) for TechCasle company as proof of my abilit to design and code in Qt/Qml/C++.
It is not complete and can have so much improvment, but basic desired functionality works fine.
***
For heavy process program must be multiThread and run time consuming codes in c++.
***
In this project I used **splashScreen** and load main page dynamicly so program has bether UX and Brand Identity.
in this project I did'nt put much c++ code, It is mostly done with js/QML.
In future I will add c++ and connect to QML as I've Taught in [my youtube Chanel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3ptA4KpnAkZI7tWram6q_Q) 
and in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nma3c3YxsUo&t=11s)
